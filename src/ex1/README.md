#Weighted, undirected graph Data Structure.
####This project provides a weighted, undirected graph data structure, and a set of algorithms to use on the graph.
The WGraph_DS class is implemented by a HashMap data structure (3 to be exact), in order to achieve constant 
runtime complexity for basic operations like adding/removing nodes/edges from the graph.

The WGraph_Algo class offers a set of algorithms including computing a deep copy 
of a graph, finding the shortest path between 2 nodes on the graph, making sure the
graph is connected (Also could have calculated # of connectivity components) and writing/reading a graph to/from a text file.

My implementation was more Breadth-First based, therefore all of the algorithms 
are implemented with some Queue data structure.
